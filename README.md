# Professional Profile
Hi! Here you can find example code I have written for different projects :)

# About Me
I have my PhD in psychology, where my focus was on using quantitative methods to tackle complex social psychological problems, for example STEM PhD student attrition. STEM PhD students face around 50% attrition, with this percentage often being higher for traditionally underrepresented groups. Additionally, the time to complete a PhD is increasing, and many students report feeling inadequately supported in pursuing non-academic careers. My journey through graduate school has been driven by a desire to conduct meaningful research that enhances student experiences and I am fortunate to be part of a lab dedicated to this important work in STEM.

# Early Research Experience
In my first project, I contributed to a thematic analysis of graduating PhD student interviews (publication here: 10.1615/JWomenMinorScienEng.2024048003). This qualitative analysis revealed the challenge of conveying the diversity of experiences— both positive and negative— given the deeply personal nature of each interview. This experience, along with the expierences of friends, family, and peers, underscored two key points for me:
- Data is Part of Someone's Story: Social data, whether qualitative or quantitative, is deeply personal; it is not just a number in a spreadsheet. Each data point represents someone who has taken the time to share their story, often detailing painful experiences within unfair systems like our PhD programs. It is crucial to handle all data with respect, critically evaluating practices like deleting small groups from the sample, summarizing across demographic groups, or removing statistical outliers without careful consideration. Every data point  deserves to be reflected in the results as accurately as possible.
- Reductionism through Statistical Assumptions: All statistical tests involve simplifications, such as assuming linear relationships between variables, capturing data at a single time point, or applying scales uniformly across groups. These simplifications can obscure the complexities of the phenomena we study, so modeling approaches need to be carefully selected to make sure they appropriately answer research questions.

# Specialization in Quantitative Methods
These insights led me to specialize in quantitative approaches for understanding social psychological phenomena. Despite its limitations, quantitative data is essential for understanding issues like graduate student attrition in a more generalizable way. My work has helped me more deeply understand the consequences of various statistical assumptions, develop a diverse statistical toolkit, and learn to clearly communicate the strengths, weaknesses and results analyses that are tailed to the research teams questions. My goal is to always deliver actionable results are appropriately nuanced but understandable and useful to a broad audience.

# My Contributions and Goals
I aim to contribute my data analytic skills to a helping stakeholders reach data-informed decisions. Throughout graduate school, I have worked diligently to develop a robust skill set, as demonstrated by the scripts in this repository.

How I Can Provide Value:
- Efficient Data Cleaning and Preparation: Save teams time with my expertise in data cleaning and preparation.
	- See the following [R Markdown script](docs/Composites-Examples.md) for an example of a composite variable script 
- Appropriate Model Application: Apply models that directly answer the team's questions, leveraging my diverse skills to choose models with appropriate assumptions based on the goals.
- Clear and Quick Presentation: Present results clearly and quickly using my data visualization skills.

Overally combining my passion for social psychology, and my quantitative expertise, I hope to make a meaningful impact for stakeholders.

** All code is written in R, but I am happy to send demonstrations in Python, Mplus, SPSS, STATA, SAS or Jamovi. 
** All examples use fake data that I simulated to demonstrate the skill set


## Teaching 
To demonstrate my strong presentation skills and that I can explain statistical content in a helpful and understandable way, I have included my teaching reviews from an introductory statistics course I taught in Fall 2023 below.  Overall 100% of students recommended me as an instructor and agreed or strongly agreed that they learned a lot in the course and the class was accepting and inclusive. Select comments are below:
- "Prof. Becky is such an amazing instructor. She helped me throughout the semester and made sure that everyone in her class gets
the help they need when they feel stuck. She is very patient, flexible, and passionate to what she does. She made the classroom
environment really positive despite the course being challenging. She is knowledgeable and reliable. I loved this class because of
her. She is awesome!"
- "Becky Neufeld was an amazing instructor. She always came to class prepared, and I could tell that she's very passionate and
knowledgeable about the material. She was always supportive; happy to clarify anything if I needed her to explain a concept again.
She gave thorough feedback on every assignment, so I knew what I needed to focus on in order to improve and demonstrate my
understanding of the material. During lab, she was very proactive; always walking around to check on everyone's progress and to
make sure that we weren't stuck. She always respected my CDA accommodations whenever I needed to use them, and checked in
to see if there was anything else she could do to support me and help me succeed."
- "I actually ended up finding this course content really valuable. I can look at scholarly papers now and understand the testing they
were doing whereas before it was a little of guesswork and skimming over the tests to try and pick out the results. Now, I can
understand the whole process, what test was used, how it was used, and how it fits in with the study. Becky did an excellent job of
explaining and showing by example how these tests are used in real studies."
